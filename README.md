This is a UI kit that shares Flutter components through my projects.

## Features

It's a collection of some common used widgets.

## Usage

Just use them like other Flutter components.

```dart
class SimpleWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const SimpleWidget({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AppVersion();
  }
}
```
